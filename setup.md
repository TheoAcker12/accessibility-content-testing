## Requirements

You need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) in order to use the two primary tools this lesson includes. If you don't already have it, go to the Chrome website and download the correct version for your operating system.

## WAVE

[WAVE (web accessibility evaluation tool)](wave.webaim.com) can be used directly from the WAVE website or added as an extension to Google Chrome or Firefox. We will be using the extension.

Go to the [WAVE Evaluation Tool extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) page in the Chrome Web Store and add it to your browser.

## Accessibility Insights for Web

Go to the [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview/) page and click **Add to Chrome** or go directly to the [Accessibility Insights extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni) page. Then add the extension to your browser.

## Testing Pages

TODO: Include instructions to access or download the sample pages we will use for testing.
