## Terminology

It may be useful, since we are talking about disabilities, to have a brief note on terminology.

- Some people prefer person-first language: Person with a disability, person who is blind, etc.
- Some people prefer identity-first language: Disabled person, blind person, etc.

Both are valid. This lesson attempts to use a mix.

- Avoid the term "differently-abled" and other euphemisms.
- Do not refer to people without disabilities as able-bodied or normal: Use "people without disabilities" or "non-disabled people" instead.
- Do not say that someone suffers from or is a victim of a disability.

More detailed information and recommendations can be found on the [Disability Language Style Guide](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/) produced by the National Center on Disability and Journalism.

## Introduction

Instructors may want to provide more or less general information about digital accessibility, depending on the experience level of the learners.

## Testing Tools

Reasons WAVE was chosen:

- WAVE has a user-friendly interface and does not require much setup to use.
- It is a well-known and respected tool.
- It is produced by [WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind)](https://webaim.org/), which is a highly reputable organization and an incredible font of accessibility knowledge.
- It highlights structural elements and features in addition to providing errors and alerts, meaning we can use it for the majority of tests we need.
- It has extensive documentation for each type of error, alert, and feature that it identifies, including how the item can impact accessibility, how to fix any potential issues, and the process WAVE uses to identify it on the page.

Instructors may or may not want to describe some of them.

When discussin how WAVE messes up formatting, instructors may want to mention the possibility of toggling styles off using the WAVE sidebar. This is not included automatically because of the increased cognitive load and because of potential pitfalls (some issues become harder or impossible to identify).

The Pass or Fail radio buttons are a useful feature in Accessibility Insights, but since we will not make use of them, it is probably better to skim or skip over them.

## Formatting

It may be useful to briefly describe color hex codes before the Checking Contrast exercise.

The Meaningful Formatting section is not particularly useful in that we cannot provide much help with how to test, but it is important for content creators to check for.

## Links

Links are the most common type of interactive element that people include in their content.

A few ideas for the dicussion on suspicious link text: show details, next, source

## Special Content

There are a number of specialized types of content that require specific accessibility considerations. There may not be a good way to easily check for these with a tool like WAVE or Accessibility Insights for Web, but they are specialized enough that we will probably know whether or not they are relevant to our content.
