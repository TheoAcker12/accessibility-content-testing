## Tables for Formatting

- WAVE structure - _Data table_ - make sure these are not used for non-tabular data
- WAVE alert - _Layout table_
    - better to avoid using entirely
    - make sure only used for non-tabular data
    - use screen reader to check that nothing weird is happening

## Tabular Data

- WAVE structure - make sure there is no tabular data without a data table
- table headers
    - no headers, and WAVE will indicate it as a layout table
    - _Table header cell_
    - _Column header cell_
    - _Row header cell_
- check that table content is not cut off? (zoom in, probably)
- table captions?
    - WAVE structure _Table caption_ vs. alert _Possible table caption_
