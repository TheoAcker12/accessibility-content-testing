## Dealing with Errors

This depends on what the CMS provides:

- When adding a form element, is it possible to set the element as required or to set restrictions on what input will be accepted? If so, try with invalid input:
    - Is the error properly identified?
    - Suggestions? (This might not make sense for content creators?)
