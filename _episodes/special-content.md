## Animation

- Check for moving, blinking, flashing, or scrolling content.
    - WAVE may provide indication for some things:
        - _Marquee_
        - _Blinking content_
    - Should be able to visually scan page - movement tends to catch the eye, and you should be aware of animated content that you have added.
    - Make sure to check for GIFs!
- If anything was found, make sure that it meets the minimum requirements or remove it.
- Also check for auto-updating content?

## AV Media and Documents

- Make sure they meet requirements.
- Laundry list for AV Media - go through list to manually check, so not much point reiterating it here
- Document testing depends on document type and all that rot - links to relevant material

## Math and Languages

- Equations and other mathematical content typically need to be communicated specially. Link to resources?
- Content in other languages (e.g. if page language is French, content in Japanese):
    - language needs to be indicated for each section of text (e.g. by default everything is assumed to be French, so everything in Japanese needs to have that specifically indicated)
    - direction should also be indicated?
