This lesson walks content creators through the process of testing their content for accessibility issues. At the conclusion of the lesson you will have a workflow for testing content and be familiar with a couple of useful testing tools.

You may benefit from this lesson if you do, or plan to do, any of the following:

- Write blog posts
- Create your own website
- Create content for a learning management system, like Canvas, Blackboard, OnPoint, or D2L
- Add or maintain content for any kind of content management system (e.g. WordPress, Grav, Drupal, Omeka, etc.)

However, anyone creating content that will live on the web in some form may find much of this information helpful, whether writing posts on social media, contributing to community projects like Wikipedia, or creating or maintaining web content in any other capacity.

Disclaimer: This lesson provides some important information for testing website accessibility, but digital accessibility is a complex and heavily nuanced field. This lesson is by no means a comprehensive study of all aspects of creating or testing for accessible content. In addition to testing your content, the following actions are advised:

1. Test the content management system itself, and correct for any errors found there. (A lesson will be provided.)
<!-- Even if you don't have any control over what system you use or what settings it has, this is still very important. You may find that there are certain types of content you need to manually change the formatting for, or even certain kinds of things you need to avoid entirely. -->
2. Strive to create content that is as accessible as possible to start with, even before testing it.
<!-- This makes your life so much easier. It is much easier to build with accessibility in mind than to go back and fix things. -->
3. Provide contact information in an easy to find location on your site, and invite accessibility feedback.
<!-- Because you never know what you might have missed until someone runs into an issue. -->
<!-- These last two are less essential. -->
4. Read additional material on digital accessibility regularly to keep up-to-date on best practices.
5. Have a certified accessibility expert test your website for issues.
